# Monitoring of Kubernetes using Sysdig Dashboard. 

IBMÂ® Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig is a cloud-native, and container-intelligence management system that you can include as part of your IBM Cloud architecture. Use it to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your applications, services, and platforms. It offers administrators, DevOps teams, and developers full stack telemetry with advanced features to monitor and troubleshoot, define alerts, and design custom dashboards. IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig is operated by Sysdig in partnership with IBM.

	6.5 From the access tabs execute the command specified in Kataconda terminal
    
		```
        ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r us-south -g default (change the region based on the cluster region)
        
		ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster replace_with_your_cluster_name
        
		(below command will come as output of executing above command)
        
        export KUBECONFIG=%HOMEPATH%\.bluemix\plugins\container-service\clusters\blqt6b8d062qlkfhap0g\kube-config-hou02-mycluster.yml
